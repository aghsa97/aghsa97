# Hello, I'm Agha! ðŸ‘‹

I have been enjoying web development for over 2 years now. It started with JavaScript at school and now I'm in so deep that even my dreams have event listeners. 

```javascript
const agha = {
  pronouns: "he" | "him",
  code: ["JavaScript", "C#", "HTML", "CSS", "Java", "GO"],
  tools: ["React", "NodeJs", "ASP.NET Core", "Spring boot", "TypeScript", "Docker"],
};
```

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to JavaScript, C#, or web development.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
